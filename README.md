a mini compiler by Salhi Adel & Salhi Abdelkader (G5) 
this mini compiler is not completed and has some bugs in it that we couldn't solve but it has at least 80% of what we've been asked to acomplish 
importing libraries 
variable declaration (int , float , char ,cont, arrays)
for loops 
no printing 
for the symboles table there is some issues that we could'nt solve due the short time we had 
it was a good experiance
